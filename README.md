##Readme:

Probably wont be pushing all files to GitHub until this project until the day its due. Nor will it be on the server. Learned my lesson from last time. If you really need help in this class, just ask. If you are just being lazy, I hope you fail.

Once my grade is up, I don't mind leaving this project up as an example.

- Edited starter js.
- Threw it in Bootstrap. Overkill, but faster css styling for the points.
- Code correctly identifies which membership the 'coupon' is in.
